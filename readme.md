# Ideas
- use capacity and size members like stl vectors and use it per-operation to know if you need to call realloc or just increment the size
- use malloc, realloc, and free instead of new and delete
- implement a view object (no construction and destruction just pointing reference) that has the same basic operation with the main classes
